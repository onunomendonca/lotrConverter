# LOTR Converter (SwiftUI Introductory Project)

This project is merely a personal introduction on SWIFT UI based on the [IOS 15 App Development with SwiftUI 3 and Swift 5 Udemy Course](https://farfetch.udemy.com/course/ios-15-app-development-with-swiftui-3-and-swift-5/). 

There are **no optimisations** on this code as its only purpose is to introduce me to SWIFT UI.

This app is a currency converter for the Lord of the Rings realm, with a unique twist of calculating the equivalent amount in euros. It features an info button to view current exchange rates. On the main screen, you can select the currency on either the left or right side. Additionally, it provides live currency exchange values that update in real-time as you type.

All of the additional code challenges of the are done on this repo.
